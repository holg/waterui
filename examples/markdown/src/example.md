# WaterUI Markdown

WaterUI supports rendering **Markdown** content natively across all platforms.

## Text Formatting

You can use **bold**, *italic*, and `inline code` in your text.
Combine them for ***bold italic*** text.

## Code Blocks

Here's a Rust example:

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, WaterUI!");
}
```

And some Swift code:

```swift
import SwiftUI

struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        Text("Hello, World!")
    }
}
```

## Lists

### Unordered List

- First item
- Second item
- Third item

### Ordered List

1. Step one
2. Step two
3. Step three

## Blockquotes

> WaterUI brings the power of native UI to Rust developers.
> Build once, run everywhere.
